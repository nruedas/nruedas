Hi, I’m Nicolas Rueda , an undergraduate in Statistics at the National University of Colombia who is endlessly curious about how numbers shape financial reality. My studies revolve around probability, time-series analysis, and the mathematical ideas that help investors navigate risk. Long-term, I want to build rigorous, transparent models that turn market data into clear insight for better economic decisions.

 On any given week you’ll catch me:

Exploring quantitative finance – modelling portfolio risk, testing factor ideas, and comparing valuation frameworks in Python and R.

Diving into applied AI – reading about NLP and reinforcement learning, then sketching ways those techniques could improve trading signals and credit analysis.

Sharpening my multilingual edge – switching between Spanish, English, and French while poring over research papers and financial news.

Sharing knowledge – organizing informal study sessions and open-notebook projects so classmates can learn together.

My next milestones are to deepen my expertise in risk management and asset allocation, publish open-source tools tailored to Latin-American markets, and pursue graduate research that blends statistics, finance, and artificial intelligence. If you’re interested in data-driven finance or simply love a good discussion about stochastic processes and market behavior, feel free to reach out!
